<h1>Irish Popcorn Company Events</h1>

<h2> Code Institute - Milestone Project 1</h2>
<!--Website mockup image goes here -->


I got the idea to make Irish Popcorn Company Events while i was at work at the real Irish Popcorn Company.
While our business currently does offer event rentals it is not very well advertised nor is it very accessible online.
I thought instead of having a small section on the current website we could split it into its own sub company with its own website
and that this could bring much more attention to our rental/event service and make it a much bigger part of the business.

This project is the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute,
 and the main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of 3 pages using HTML5 and CSS3.

<h2>Design Process:</h2>

<h3>Strategy Plane:</h3>
The main goal of the website is to attract users who are looking to hire concession machinery and equipment to give their private function a bit more flair.
The website is aimed at both domestic and corporate users with packages available to cater for all sizes. It should include imagery of the machines available the products that come with the machines and also past events that have used our services.
I started the UX process by thinking about what i would like to see if i was looking to hire out concession equipment for my own event.
