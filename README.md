<h1>Irish Popcorn Company Events</h1>

<h2> Code Institute - Milestone Project 1</h2>
<!--Website mockup image goes here -->


I got the idea to make Irish Popcorn Company Events while i was at work at the real Irish Popcorn Company.
While our business currently does offer event rentals it is not very well advertised nor is it very accessible online.
I thought instead of having a small section on the current website we could split it into its own sub company with its own website
and that this could bring much more attention to our rental/event service and make it a much bigger part of the business.

This project is the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute,
 and the main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of 3 pages using HTML5 and CSS3.

<h3>Business Owner:</h3>

<li>I am the business owner i want to see the business grow and succeed, i want to display all information about renting our machines in a clear and attractive way.
i also want users to be able to quickly and easily contact our company with questions or to arrange a booking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Process:</h2>

<h3>Strategy Plane:</h3>
The main goal of the website is to attract users who are looking to hire concession machinery and equipment to give their private function a bit more flair.
The website is aimed at both domestic and corporate users with packages available to cater for all sizes. It should include imagery of the machines available the products that come with the machines and also past events that have used our services.
I started the UX process by thinking about what i would like to see if i was looking to hire out concession equipment for my own event.

<h3>Scope Plane:</h3>
The main features on the website are based around what the user needs, i want the user to be able to
<ul>
<li>pick a rental package that caters for their needs</li>
<li>easily get in contact either to book or ask any questions they might have</li>
<li>See images of past events the company have done so they get a better idea of what we can do</li>
<li>navigate the site quick and easy</li>
<li>have the option of accessing the companies social media</li>
<li>Learn about the history of the compamy and what its about</li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure plane:</h3>
This is where i thought about the overall layout and navigation of the website
After the homepage my second most important page is my packages page so i decided to layout the navigation starting in that order.
I split my features into 5 main pages and laid them out in the order of importance Home, Packages, Gallery, History, Contact
i wanted to have a bit of consistency accross #my pages so i decided to have a title on the top of each page before the main Content
this keeps each page looking similar, i thought about giving each page the same layout but i decided against it as the content between pages are so different i didnt want to be 
restricted by the one page design.


<h3>Skeleton Plane:</h3>
This stage is when i put together my wireframes which i used Figma to create.
I created a wireframe for each page on desktop/laptop tablet and mobile.

i wanted the user to be presented with a simple clean nav bar with 5 choices,
Home, Packages, Gallery, History, Contact.

on the home page the user is greeted with a hero image then below follows reasons to use us , a list of our partners and some customer reviews.
On the Packages page the user is instantly able to see all the rental packages and what they include, each package will have a link to contact form.
On the Gallery page i will have a large gallery of past events so the user can have an idea of what to expect.
on the history page i will have a brief history of the company and what it stands for so the user can understand the company and get to know us a little better.
On the Contact page the user is presented with a clean simple contact form to get in touch about bookings or questions.

During the construction of the wireframes i debated whether to include some of the gallery on the home page with a link to take you to the main gallery page.
I thought the gallery would help the user make a decision on whether to book a rental with us so it might be good to include upfront.
In the end i decided against it as i thought customer reviews would be a better fit to the overall design of the homepage, i also didnt want to overlap too much content between pages.

The full wireframes can be viewed on <a href="#">Figma</a>

<h3>Surface Plane:</h3>

This section is when i focused on the design of my site.

Colours: Since IPEvents is a devision of Irish Popcorn And Snackfood Company i decided to keep the colour scheme generally inline with the colours of Irish Popcorn.
While i decided to use the theme of Irish Popcorns red and gold i changed shades and added some colours along the way to make sure this site has its own identity.
I decided to use #f1a602 and rgb(129, 27, 27) as my dominant red and gold colours and then used #dadada #383838 as my accent and font colours.

Fonts: As the parent company Irish Popcorn and Snackfood Company supply cinemas with all their concession i thought it would be a great idea to bring that into the rental site by 
using an Art Deco style font for the headers and logo. I found Limelight on google fonts and thought it was the perfect font to achieve this look.
i then used Poppins for my main text and navbar options and i thought it was clear and easy to read giving a good contrast to Limelight while also giving a lighthearted feel which i thought is important 
as the main focus of this site is around parties and events.

Images: I was able to get my images of machines and logos from Irish Popcorn Comapnies Database
although i did use google images for the past events pictures in the gallery.

Layout: I wanted to create a slight contrast between different areas of content on my homepage so i used a light grey colour of #dadada for the backgrounf of some sections and then left others white.
i decided to keep the navbar and footer the same colour of red with light grey writing and then have gold accents throughout keeping my colour scheme consistant across each page.
i decided to give any button or link a gold highlight on hover to tie in with the theme.

<h3>Testing User stories:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>I am a user that is new to hiring out Snack food equipment i want to know why it is worth my time hiring our these machines for my private fuction.</em>
on the homepage the user is met with a navbar containing links to all 5 pages <b>Home, Packages, Gallery, History, Contact</b>
they are then met with a hero image showing one of our machines at an event being enjoyed.
they can see the benefits of using us. They can then see below great reviews from past customers </li>
<li><em>I want to know what the Irish Popcorn Company Events offers that sets them apart from other rental companies</em>
This user can navigate to the partner section that displays the companies that our site is partnered with, 
This ensures the user that the quality of machinery we offer is unmatched by any other company on the market. 
</li>
<li><em>I want to be able to tailor my own rental package and have a way to organise a booking for a specific date.</em>
This user can navigate to the packages page and select the create your own packages option,
which explains what options they have to choose from. they will then be brought to the contact form where they can fill out what specifics they want.</li>

<h3>Validating the code:</h3>

I validated both <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> with <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>

<h3>Testing on different browsers:</h3>

I manually tested the website on the following browsers:
<ul>
<li>Chrom</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Edge</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing responsiveness on multiple devices and screen sizes:</h3>
I manually tested the website by using Google Developer Tools to check each individual page and the website as a whole worked on different devices and different screen sizes,
including: Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5 SE, iiPhone X, iPad,Phone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus,  iPad Pro. 
I also manually tested the site on my Pc/Laptop, Samsung tab s6, and Pixel 3.

<h3>Issues Found:</h3>


<ul>
<li>i had an issue with content on pages overlapping my footer so i created a custom spacer div for each 
page to give them a nice amount of room between content and footer.</li>
<li>I orginally decided to put a logo picture in the navbar but when resizing it seemed to get too small and look off, i decided 
to replace it with a text logo instead as i found that looked alot better.</li>
</ul>
